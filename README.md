# Headsfeet
Just like the No Hats mod except it keeps the cosmetics that cause invisible body regions such as invisible feet on Scout and
invisible heads on Pyro's.

# How to install:
1. Download the mod from GitHub. It should be downloaded as a .zip file.

2. Open the .zip file. Inside should be a folder named "Headsfeet-master". Open that folder.

3. Extract the .vpk to steam > steamapps > common > Team Fortress 2 > tf > custom

You should now be able to boot into your game and have the mod load perfectly.


As of December 2018, I will no longer be maintaining this mod.
